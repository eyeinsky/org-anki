AnkiConnect [[https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect][homepage]], [[https://github.com/amikey/anki-connect/issues][github]]: org-anki talks to the Anki app via
AnkiConnect's HTTP API, so this is highly relevant if you want to
contribute.

** Development ideas
- Switch away from [[https://melpa.org/#/promise][promise]] to either [[https://melpa.org/#/async][async]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/deferred][deferred]], both of which
  have lots more users and might thus be easier to use.
- Move elisp code talking to AnkiConnect API to a separate file (and
  in the long run possibly make it a separate package).
- Generate a reference for customizable variables from source, instead
  of maintaining it manually.
